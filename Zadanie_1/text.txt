History of the Internet 
From its very beginnings the Internet became a crucial part of each and any infrastructure. 
Similar to the discoveries of electricity, microorganisms or elementary particles, the creation of the Internet has turned a new page in the history of humanity. 
The history of the Internet has begun in the middle of the 20th century as a result of rapid development of computer science. 
Computers of that age were still relatively underperforming and needed constant maintenance. 
Some kind of an effective and automated method of time-sharing between users needed to be devised and implemented for them to work reliably. 
The first idea that had emerged from that necessity was a concept of multi-tasking. 
Nowadays we donâ€™t pay much attention to the fact that our computers perform many tasks at once, and that with our computers we can, for example, work and listen to music at the same time. 
But in the 1950s this idea turned out to be revolutionary. 
The second idea would be a proposition to merge multiple computers into a single network. 
Each participant1 of such a network would be able to exchange data with the others. 
But the exact mechanism of implementation was still largely a mystery. 
Roughly for ten years the scientists were developing and discarding all kinds of ideas, one after another, preserving those that could be at least somewhat handy bit by bit. 
This is how the prototypes of packet exchange protocols (as well as the concept of a data packet itself) came to be.
